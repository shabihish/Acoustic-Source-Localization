# Acoustic Source Localization
* phase1: This phase deals with basic implementations of the source localization algorithm. Different DL mehtods based on source research papers were implemented and tested for accuracy and usability. Final results and common problems were documented and reported for fixes.

**Note:** Access to the underlying dataset is restricted due to the project policies.
